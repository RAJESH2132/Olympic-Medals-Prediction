# Olympic-Medals-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

This project focuses on predicting a country's medal count in the Olympics using machine learning techniques. By leveraging historical and current data from the Olympic games, this project aims to create a predictive model that can estimate the number of medals a country might win. 

## Project Overview

In this project, we delve into the world of machine learning, specifically focusing on predictive modeling. We utilize Python programming language and Jupyter Notebook for our analysis. The key steps involved in this project are as follows:

1. **Data Collection:** Gather historical data from Olympic games, including details about countries, sports, athletes, and medal counts.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the data to make it suitable for machine learning algorithms. This includes handling missing values, converting categorical data, and feature scaling.

3. **Feature Selection:** Identify the most relevant features that can influence a country's medal count. This step involves data analysis and domain knowledge.

4. **Model Selection:** Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for the prediction task. Experiment with different algorithms and select the one that provides the best results.

5. **Model Training:** Train the selected model on the preprocessed data to learn the patterns and relationships within the data.

6. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance using suitable metrics. This step involves analyzing the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.

7. **Prediction:** Use the trained model to make predictions about medal counts for upcoming Olympic events.
